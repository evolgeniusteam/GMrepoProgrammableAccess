## Phenotypes
### Get all phenotypes and statistics

`input`: none,

`output`: an `array`
```Perl
### -- get all phenotypes  --
my $url1 = 'https://gmrepo.humangut.info/api/get_all_phenotypes';
my $req1 = HTTP::Request->new('POST' => $url1);
my $all_phenotypes = decode_json($ua->request($req1)->content())->{'phenotypes'};

### -- select the valid key-value pairs
my @col = ('disease','term','note', 'all_samples', 'processed_runs','valid_runs','failed_runs','nr_species','nr_genus');
my $row = @$all_phenotypes;
my @phenotypes = map{my %h;@h{@col}=@$_{@col};\%h}@$all_phenotypes[0..($row-1)];

### -- the resulting variable is an array of hashes
print "print the top 5 elements:\n";
print Dumper(@phenotypes[0..4]);
```
The `array` `phenotypes` contains phenotypes and related statistics as shown in https://gmrepo.humangut.info/phenotypes, the elements of '@phenotypes' are anonymous hashes.

### Get statistics on a phenotype
Using the corresponding MeSH ID  (e.g. `D006262` for `Health `), uses can first obtain some statistics information of the phenotype, including:
* nr of associated species/genera
* nr of total/processed/qualified runs
* and other information

`input`: a MeSH ID,

`output`: a `scalar`
```Perl
## -- get summary information by mesh_id
my $url2 = 'https://gmrepo.humangut.info/api/getStatisticsByProjectsByMeshID';
my $res2 = $ua->post($url2,Content => '{"mesh_id": "D006262"}');## -- to get statistics on MeSH ID D006262
my $phenotype_stats = decode_json($res2->content());

### -- the resulting variable is a reference to a hash of hashes
print "\$phenotype_stats:","\n";
print Dumper($phenotype_stats);
```

### Get associated species of a phenotype
Again the MeSH ID `D006262` will be needed as the input:

`input`: a MeSH ID,

`output`: a `scalar`
```Perl
## -- all associted species --
## -- please note only species that are found in >= 2 runs & with median relative abundance >= 0.01% will be retrieved
my $url3 = 'https://gmrepo.humangut.info/api/getAssociatedSpeciesByMeshID';
my $res3 = $ua->post($url3,Content => '{"mesh_id": "D006262"}');
my $phenotype_assoc_species = decode_json($res3->content());

### -- the resulting variable is a reference to an array of hashes
print "print the top 5 elements:\n";
print Dumper(@$phenotype_assoc_species[0..4]);
```

### Get associated genera of a phenotype

`input`: a MeSH ID,

`output`: a `scalar`
```Perl
## -- all associted genera --
## -- please note only genera that are found in >= 2 runs & with median relative abundance >= 0.01% will be retrieved
my $url4 = 'https://gmrepo.humangut.info/api/getAssociatedGeneraByMeshID';
my $res4 = $ua->post($url4,Content => '{"mesh_id": "D006262"}');
my $phenotype_assoc_genera = decode_json($res4->content());

### -- the resulting variable is a reference to an array of hashes
print "print the top 5 elements:\n";
print Dumper(@$phenotype_assoc_genera[0..4]);
```

### Calculate species/genera prevalence
**Prevalence** refers to the percentage of runs in which a species/genus is found out of the total number of valid runs; the latter can be found in `$phenotype_stats->{stats}->{nr_valid_samples}`.
```Perl
## calculate species/genera prevalence for all species associated with Health (D006262):
my @species_prevalence = map {
        $_->{samples} / $phenotype_stats->{stats}->{nr_valid_samples} * 100
}@$phenotype_assoc_species;

## calculate species prevalence for all genera associated with Health (D006262):
my @genera_prevalence = map {
        $_->{samples} / $phenotype_stats->{stats}->{nr_valid_samples} * 100
}@$phenotype_assoc_species;
```

### Get associated projects

`input`: a MeSH ID,

`output`: a `scalar`
```Perl
## -- all associted projects --
my $url6 = 'https://gmrepo.humangut.info/api/getAssociatedProjectsByMeshID';
my $res6 = $ua->post($url6,Content => '{"mesh_id": "D006262"}');
my $phenotype_assoc_pros = decode_json($res6->content());

### -- the resulting variable is a reference to an array of hashes
print "print the top 5 elements:\n";
print Dumper(@$phenotype_assoc_pros[0..4]);
```
Please note very often a project may contain samples/runs of multiple phenotypes.

### Get curated projects

`input`: NULL,

`output`: a `scalar`
```Perl
## -- all associted projects --
my $url6 = 'https://gmrepo.humangut.info/api/getCuratedProjectsList';
my $res6 = $ua->post($url6,Content => '{}');
my $curated_pros = decode_json($res6->content());

### -- the resulting variable is a reference to an array of hashes
print "print the top 5 elements:\n";
print Dumper(@$curated_pros[0..4]);
```


### Get associated runs
Some phenotypes are associated with tens of thousands of runs (e.g. `Health (D006262)`) that are too many to be retrieved with one call. Therefore it may take a two-step procedure to retrieve all runs associated with phenotype.

First, count the number of runs associated with a phenotype:

`input`: a MeSH ID,

`output`: a `scalar`
```Perl
## -- count associated runs --
my $url7 = 'https://gmrepo.humangut.info/api/countAssociatedRunsByPhenotypeMeshID';
my $res7 = $ua->post($url7,Content => '{"mesh_id": "D006262"}');
my $phenotyp_nr_assoc_runs = decode_json($res7->content());

### -- the resulting variable is a reference to an array of hash
print (keys %{@$phenotyp_nr_assoc_runs[0]},":",values %{@$phenotyp_nr_assoc_runs[0]},"\n");
```

Then users can use a loop retrieve the associated runs, 100 runs at a time:

`input`: a MeSH ID, the number of records to skip, the number of records to retrieve; see below.

`output`: a `scalar`
```Perl
## -- get all associted runs --
## use skip = 0, limit = 100 to retrieve the first 100 runs, then
##     skip = 100, limit = 100 to retrieve the next 100 runs ....
my $url8 = 'https://gmrepo.humangut.info/api/getAssociatedRunsByPhenotypeMeshIDLimit';
my $res8 = $ua->post($url8,Content => '{"mesh_id": "D006262", "skip": 0, "limit": 100}');
my $phenotyp_a_page_of_assoc_runs = decode_json($res8->content());

### -- the resulting variable is a reference to an array of hashes
print "print the top 5 elements:\n";
print Dumper(@$phenotyp_a_page_of_assoc_runs[0..4]);
```

### Get relative species/genus abundances in samples/runs associated with a phenotype
To get the related information, two input parameters are required:
* MeSH ID of interests, e.g. `D003093` for `Colitis, Ulcerative`
* NCBI taxonomy ID of the species/genus of interests, e.g. `40520` for `Blautia obeum (species)`.

```Perl
my $url9 = 'https://gmrepo.humangut.info/api/getMicrobeAbundancesByPhenotypeMeshIDAndNCBITaxonID';
my $res9 = $ua->post($url9,Content => '{"mesh_id": "D003093","ncbi_taxon_id": "40520"}');
my $data = decode_json($res9->content());

### -- the resulting variable is a reference to a hash of hashes
print "This data set contains the following information:\n";
print join("," ,keys %{$data},"\n");
```
The resulting `$data` is a reference to a hash of hashes containing:
* `hist_data_for_phenotype`: the value corresponding to this key contains the distribution of the relative abundances of the species/genus of interests in all samples of current phenotype,
* `hist_data_for_health`: if current phenotype is not `Health`, the  distribution of the relative abundances of the species/genus of interests in all samples of `Health` will also be retrieved,
* `abundant_data_for_disease`: the value corresponding to this key contains the relative abundance data of the species/genus of interests in all samples of current phenotype,
* `abundant_data_for_health`: if current phenotype is not `Health`, the relative abundances of the species/genus of interests in all samples of `Health` will also be retrieved,
* `taxon`: NCBI taxonomy information for current taxonomy ID,
* `disease`: details of current phenotype,
* `abundance_and_meta_data`: runs in which current taxon is found and related meta data,
* `co_occurred_taxa`: cooccurred taxa of the taxon of interests in current phenotype

See https://gmrepo.humangut.info/phenotypes/D003093/40520 for more details.

## Species/genera
### Get an overview of the species/genera

`input`: none,

`output`: a `scalar`.
```Perl
### --- get all species and genera that presented in >= 2 runs with median relative abundance >= 0.01%
my $url10 = 'https://gmrepo.humangut.info/api/get_all_gut_microbes';
my $req10 = HTTP::Request->new('POST' => $url10);
my $data10 = decode_json($ua->request($req10)->content());

### -- the resulting variable is a reference to a hash of hashes
print "This data set contains the following information:\n";
print join("," ,keys %{$data10},"\n");
```
The retrieved `data` is a list containing:
* `all_species`:the value corresponding to this key contains all species that presented in >= 2 runs with median relative abundance >= 0.01%,
* `all_genus`: the value corresponding to this key contains all genera that presented in >= 2 runs with median relative abundance >= 0.01%,
* `metadata`: the value corresponding to this key contains additional statistics:
  * `loaded_samples`: nr. qualified runs for which the relative abundance data are available,
  * `all_species_count`: nr. all species
  * `retrieved_species_count`: nr. species in the `array`: `all_species`,
  * `all_genus_count`: nr. all genera,
  * `retrieved_genus_count`: nr. genera in the `array`: `all_genus`.

With the retrieved data, users can plot the **species prevalence in phenotypes** and **species prevalence in samples**, as shown at https://gmrepo.humangut.info/species.

### Get summary information of the prevalence and relative abundance of a species/genus in all associated phenotypes

`data input`: ncbi taxonomy id of a species/genus,

`data output`: a `scalar`

my $res12 = $ua->post($url12,Content => '{"ncbi_taxon_id": "40520"}');
my $data12 = decode_json($res12->content())->{'phenotypes_associated_with_taxon'};

### -- the resulting variable is a reference to an array of hashes
print "print the top 5 elements:\n";
print Dumper(@$data12[0..4]);
```

### Get detailed information of the prevalence and relative abundance of a species/genus in all associated phenotypes

`data input`: ncbi taxonomy id of a species/genus,

`data output`: a `scalar`
```Perl

* `phenotypes_associated_with_taxon`: the value corresponding to this key contains summary information on associated phenotypes,
* `taxon`: the value corresponding to this key contains detailed information about this taxon, such as scientific name and taxonomic level,
* `density_data_groupped`: the value corresponding to this key is a reference to a hash, contains abundance information of the current taxon in an associated phenotype; the number of key-value pairs corresponds to the number of phenotypes the current taxon is associated with.

The retrieved data can be used to generate the plots at https://gmrepo.humangut.info/species/40520.

### Get relative species/genus abundances for a sample/run

Two APIs are available here, namely `getRunDetailsByRunID` and `getFullTaxonomicProfileByRunID`. The usages are the same (see below). However, `getFullTaxonomicProfileByRunID` will produce the full taxonomic profiles at species and genus levels, while `getRunDetailsByRunID` only produces the top ten most abundant ones, and merge the others into a 'Others' category.

`input`: run ID, e.g. `ERR475468`,

`output`: a `scalar`, see below:
```Perl
my $url14 = 'https://gmrepo.humangut.info/api/getFullTaxonomicProfileByRunID';
my $res14 = $ua->post($url14,Content => '{"run_id":"ERR475468"}');
my $data14 = decode_json($res14->content());

### -- the resulting variable is a reference to a hash of hashes
print "This data set contains the following information:\n";
print join(",",keys %{$data14},"\n");
```
The retrieved `$data` is a reference to a hash of hashes containing:
* `run`: the value corresponding to this key is a reference to a hash, contains run metadata,
* `species`: the value corresponding to this key is a reference to an array, contains relative abundances of all species,
* `genus`: the value corresponding to this key is a reference to an array, contains relative abundances of all genera.

See https://gmrepo.humangut.info/data/run/ERR475468 for details.

### Get relative species/genus abundances for a project
`data input`: project id, e.g. `PRJNA489760`, and a MeSH ID

`data output`: a `list`
```Perl
my $url15 = 'https://gmrepo.humangut.info/api/getMicrobeAbundancesByPhenotypeMeshIDAndProjectID';

# Get relative species/genus abundances for all phenotypes
my $res15 = $ua->post($url15,Content => '{"project_id":"PRJNA489760","mesh_id":""}');

# Get relative species/genus abundances for one of the phenotype in the project
my $res15 = $ua->post($url15,Content => '{"project_id":"PRJNA489760","mesh_id":"D006262"}');

my $data15 = decode_json($res15->content());
### -- the resulting variable is a reference to a hash of hashes
print "This data set contains the following information:\n";
print join(",",keys %{$data15},"\n");

```
The retrieved `data` is a `list` containing:
* `project_info`: the value corresponding to this key is a reference to a hash, contains project information
* `disease_info`: the value corresponding to this key is a reference to a hash, contains disease information
* `abundance_and_meta_data`: the value corresponding to this key is a reference to an array, contains relative abundances of the project.
